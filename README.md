# This is made to make random numbers for the pirate game.
# See more about the pirate game [here](https://www.bgpschool.kent.sch.uk/attachments/download.asp?file=1565&type=pdf).
# To use:
# When asked to quit, input q if you want to end the program early, and input c if someone landed on a choose next square tile, then put in the tile they selected, and if that is someone else's choose next square tile, input c again.
# For mode 1, input the number of players that are participating, then at the end of a turn or the start of the game, if noone landed on choose next square, all of them will submit a square that they want to be called, and an equal number of random tiles will be generated, and one will be chosen as the next tile.
# For mode 2, input any key but q or c when asked if you want to quit to continue, and a random number will be generated.
# For mode 3, two numbers will be generated, designated 1 and 2, then ask the people playing which one they would like, and if there is a majority, select that tile by inputing 1 or 2 depending on which got the most votes. If there is a tie, you can just choose the first one or flip a coin.
